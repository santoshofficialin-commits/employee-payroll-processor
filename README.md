# Employee Payroll Processor (C)

A modular C program that processes employee salary data using arrays and reusable functions.
The project demonstrates clean separation of business logic and scalable data handling.

---

## Overview

This program calculates employee bonuses and total salaries based on a predefined bonus policy.
Salary data is stored in arrays and processed using loops and dedicated functions.

---

## Key Concepts Demonstrated

- Array-based data processing
- Function reuse and separation of concerns
- Use of constants instead of magic numbers
- Clean and readable program structure
